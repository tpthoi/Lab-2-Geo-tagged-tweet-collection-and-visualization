# Lab-2-Geo-tagged-tweet-collection-and-visualization

<p>I will be comparing the west and east cost in order to see if people's tweet are different base on their environment. I visited the East Coast Last Year and I feel like the people there are very differient compare to people living back in seattle. For this project I will being using washington as their northwest most area and Florida as the southwest most area. I will being using their tweets too see if they represent different context.</p>

<p>Majority of the Tweets in washington are coming out of the Seattle Area. I feel like since we're a technological city we are bound to have a lot of people using twitter. In Florida, I was suprise to see only a few tweets coming out of miami since It's a major city in the United States like Seattle but more tweeters are from Tampa and Orlando. From the map We can conlude that many tweeters are tweeting from well-known techonology city compare to other cities and county.</p>

### Word Cloud

<p>Looking at the Florida Word Cloud, I can see words like jimmy butler, heats and miami since they deal alot with their basketball team and jimmy butler is a player on that team. Compare to Seattle where we don't have a professional basketball team these terms are more likely to appear. In the Washington Word Cloud, I see terms like University which is obviously talking about UW, "Gas" talking about the park gas works and common states like oregon which is literally below washington. I can tell from the word cloud that people shared diffierent opinions depending on where they are living but also shared a common space online. They shared slang,ancroynm like LOL. WE can clearly see similiar and contrasting view between the two state.</p>
